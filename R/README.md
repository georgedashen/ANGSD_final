clustering_visual.m: Matlab script, implement interpolation and hierarchical clustering and expression profile visualization

initial_PCA_heatmap.R: PCA on all samples, heatmap drawing and found clusters grouped by cell lines

meta_featureCounts.R: visualization of assignments of mapped reads to features, distribution of mapped features which could be used for further analysis

time_course_PCA.R: implement PCA on each cell lines and found different patterns
